Fortunately exists **Continuous Integration**
 
 Continuous Integration (or CI for short) is one of those buzz words that have become really popular lately. Itâ€™s the idea that instead of having long-lived feature branches that you use to work on a new feature, you continuously integrate your new code into the projectâ€™s main branch (which is usually master or develop if you work with Git). Every time you do so you build the project and run its tests, to make sure everything is in order before merging the change in.
 To help Code Review exists tools (like Sonar, Lizard etc.) that helps developers to understand (and fix ðŸ¤—) their mistakes.
 
 - Note: This is an example of working flow using XCode Server

 Tools helps developer to fix his code to be compliant with:
 * Security (OWASP Best Practice)
 * Code Style
 * Possible Bug
 * Code Smells
 * Code Duplication
 
 Most common tools are:
 * Xcode Server/Bots
 * Jenkins
 * TravisCI
 * CircleCI
 * Fastlane
 * Sonar & Sonarqube
